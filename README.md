# TECHICAL PAPER - OBJECTS

## Introduction to Objects

* There are only seven fundamental data types in JavaScript, and six of those are the primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. With the seventh type, objects, we open our code to more complex possibilities.
* An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

## Creating Object Literals

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type. We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

 ```let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object```
